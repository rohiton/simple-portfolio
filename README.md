# simple-portfolio
A simple static portfolio application designed with Bootstrap framework.

## How to create a portfolio similar to this?

1. Create a repository on github with the name similar to this, {github-username}.github.io eg: rohiton.github.io
2. Now clone this repository using this command, `git clone https://github.com/rohiton/simple-portfolio`
3. Inside the clonned project, delete the .git directory
4. Run the below commands to push the code to your repository

```
git init
git add .
git remote add origin {git-repo-origin}
git commit -m "first-commit"
git push -f origin master
```

This will push the code to your newly created repository and you can check your portfolio now at {git-username}.github.io

Note: It'll take some time to host your static pages.
